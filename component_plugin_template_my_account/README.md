# Page and Component Plugin Template - My Account Components
This project contains an example of creating plugins of type component. Components are just React components. What it does and how it is
implemented depends on the project requirements.

Just for the purpose of demonstrating how to implement component plugins, this example project will implement a couple of components to
replace the BizConsole's Personal Info component.

Let's assume we don't like the BizConsole's Personal Info component that are displayed in the My Account page. We want to separate the
user's personal info and user preference as 2 different components. Therefore, we created this plugin that implements 2 components to
display the logged in user's info and preference.
